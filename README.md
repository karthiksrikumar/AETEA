# AETEA
Overview
The AI Environmental Transparency & Efficiency Act (AETEA) establishes crucial standards for AI energy consumption and environmental impact reporting. This policy demonstrates how organizations can achieve compliance and also highlights OATNet's architecture as a potential implentation.

## Why This Matters

AI data centers projected to consume 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028
Traditional LLM training uses 1,287 MWh (equivalent to 120 U.S. homes daily)
Single model training can consume up to 700,000 liters of water
GPT-3 operations emit 8.4 tons of COâ‚‚ annually

AETEA Core Requirements
1. Mandatory AI Carbon & Energy Reporting (AI-CER)
Required Metrics

Energy consumption per inference
Total carbon emissions from training
Data center energy source breakdown
Computational efficiency measurements
Water usage for cooling systems
