## Overview

The AI Environmental Transparency & Efficiency Act (AETEA) establishes mandatory standards for AI energy consumption reporting and incentivizes environmental sustainability in the AI industry. This guide provides comprehensive implementation instructions for organizations to achieve and maintain compliance.

### Purpose
* Establish mandatory reporting standards for AI energy consumption
* Incentivize sustainable AI practices
* Enable informed decision-making through transparency
* Reduce the environmental impact of AI systems

## Compliance Requirements

### 1. AI Carbon & Energy Reporting (AI-CER) Labeling

#### Required Metrics
* Energy consumption per inference
* Total carbon emissions from training
* Data center energy source breakdown
* Computational threshold tracking
* Environmental impact assessments

#### Example AI-CER Label Format
```
